## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
The Resume CMS platform is a web-based application designed to help users create and manage their resumes seamlessly. It employs Python Flask for the backend API, Nameko for microservices, Vue.js for the frontend application, PostgreSQL for the database, and Docker for containerization.

### 1.2 Purpose
The platform aims to provide an intuitive and feature-rich environment for users to build, update, and share their resumes. It caters to professionals, job seekers, and anyone looking for an efficient way to showcase their skills and experiences.

### 1.3 Key Features
- User-friendly resume builder
- Multiple resume templates
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Secure user authentication
- Version-controlled resume editing
- Seamless deployment using Docker

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Backend (Python Flask & Nameko)
The backend is built on Python Flask, serving as the primary API, and Nameko for microservices. Flask handles user authentication, resume creation, and editing, while Nameko manages distributed tasks like template rendering and document conversion.

### 2.2 Frontend (Vue.js)
Vue.js is used for building a dynamic and responsive user interface. It interacts with the Flask API to fetch and update resume data, providing users with an interactive and smooth experience.

### 2.3 Database (PostgreSQL)
PostgreSQL is chosen as the relational database to store user data, resume templates, and other relevant information. It ensures data consistency and allows for efficient querying.

### 2.4 Containerization (Docker)
Docker containers encapsulate each component, ensuring consistency across different environments. It simplifies deployment, scaling, and maintenance.

## 3. Getting Started

### 3.1 Prerequisites
- Python (3.7 or higher)
- Node.js
- Vue CLI
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

### 3.2 Installation
Clone the repository and follow instructions in the setup guide to install dependencies and set up the development environment.

### 3.3 Configuration
Update configuration files for Flask, Nameko, Vue.js, and PostgreSQL based on your environment. Configuration files are located in the `config` directory.

## 4. Backend API (Flask & Nameko)

### 4.1 API Endpoints
Refer to the API documentation for details on available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

### 4.2 Authentication
The platform uses token-based authentication to secure API endpoints. Users must authenticate to create, edit, or delete resumes.

### 4.3 Microservices (Nameko)
Nameko microservices handle tasks such as template rendering and document conversion asynchronously. Refer to the Nameko service documentation for implementation details.

### 4.4 Error Handling
The API provides detailed error responses for invalid requests. Refer to the error handling documentation for troubleshooting.

## 5. Frontend Application (Vue.js)

### 5.1 Project Structure
Understand the Vue.js project structure and how components are organized. Follow best practices for Vue.js development.

### 5.2 Components
Explore and customize Vue.js components for resume creation, editing, and template rendering. Component documentation provides insights into each component's functionality.

### 5.3 State Management
Vuex is employed for state management. Understand how the application state is managed and updated throughout the user's interactions.

### 5.4 Styling
Utilize the styling guide for consistent and visually appealing UI. The platform uses a responsive design to ensure optimal user experience on various devices.

## 6. Database (PostgreSQL)

### 6.1 Schema Design
Review the PostgreSQL schema to understand how user data, resumes, and templates are structured.

### 6.2 Data Models
Detailed documentation on data models, relationships, and constraints is provided for developers working on database-related tasks.

### 6.3 Relationships
Understand the relationships between different tables in the database schema and how data integrity is maintained.

### 6.4 Migrations
Learn how to manage database migrations using tools like Alembic to apply changes to the database schema.

## 7. Docker Technology

### 7.1 Containerization
Understand how Docker containers encapsulate each component of the platform. Learn how to build, run, and manage containers for development and production environments.

### 7.2 Docker Compose
Utilize Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications. The `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for easy setup and configuration.

## 8. Deployment

### 8.1 Deployment Strategies
Explore deployment strategies for various environments, including development, staging, and production.

### 8.2 Scaling
Learn about scaling options using container orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing the platform in a scalable and efficient manner.

### 8.3 Monitoring and Logging
Implement monitoring and logging tools to ensure the health and performance of the application in production.

## 9. Testing

### 9.1 Unit Testing
Detailed documentation on writing and running unit tests for both backend and frontend components.

### 9.2 Integration Testing
Guidelines for integration testing to ensure seamless communication between different components.

### 9.3 End-to-End Testing
Learn how to perform end-to-end testing to validate the complete functionality of the platform.

## 10. Security

### 10.1 Authentication & Authorization
Understand the authentication process and how authorization is implemented to ensure secure access to resources.

### 10.2 Secure Communications
Ensure secure communication between frontend, backend, and microservices using HTTPS.

### 10.3 Data Protection
Implement measures to protect user data, including encryption and secure storage practices.

## 11. Maintenance

### 11.1 Regular Backups
Set up regular backups for the database to prevent data loss in case of unexpected events.

### 11.2 Version Control
Follow version control best practices using Git to track changes and collaborate effectively.

### 11.3 Continuous Integration
Implement continuous integration workflows to automate testing and deployment processes.

## 12. Troubleshooting
